# RECORD RECOMMENDATION
The point of this project is to reccomend popular music based on the genre selected.

## Description

Using fetch from three seperate API's the code gets the data from the website and retuns the music based on the genre clicked and whatever is inside the playlist. users can also comment new music. 

## Goals
* user is able to click on a genre button
* user can submit a new song in the text bar 
* user can reset the page with the reset button

### Dependencies

* CORS allowance extension
* ex. Windows 10



### Executing program

* click on the genre and it will execute the fetch function to receive the data


## Help

Any CORS issue is a result of not having the correct accessing extension.
